In collaboration with world leaders in digital humanities from the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), UMD Libraries and the Perseus Digital Library, we want to create Persian Literature 2.0 and radically transform the ways Persian language, literature and culture are learned, studied and preserved in the 21st century.</p>
